REQUIREMENTS

You will need the following to build the package:

- a C++ compiler
- the Boost C++ library
- Python 2.5
- Automake/Autoconf/Libtool
- binutils and GCC for cross-compiling to a MIPS target


INSTALLATION

For compiling and running programs for DAR, it's convenient to install the
package somewhere in a local directory, e.g., $HOME/dar-inst, and add the bin
subdirectory there to your PATH.  This way you can not only run the tools from
anywhere, but you can use dar-rts-config to automagically obtain the
appropriate include and link flags (see the Makefiles for the examples).

The first time:

    ./bootstrap
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/dar-inst
    make
    make install

Afterwards you only need to make (and possibly make install); the makefiles and
so on will be regenerated automagically as needed.

You can run

   darsim --version

to make sure it's in your path.


EXAMPLES

These are (surprisingly enough) found in the examples directory.  When in a directory containing an example (e.g., examples/hello) you can build and simulate like this (provided you have installed everything as described above):

    make
    make run

Examine the makefiles for details.
